# photographer-template Reflection

What did I learn during my project?
During this project, I have learned a lot about building a website completely from scratch. I also realized how much you can actually do with just HTML and CSS. Even though I had some experience before, this project gave me the chance to practice more and see how far I could take it.

What was my biggest challenge and how did I approach it?

The biggest challenge for me was building the whole website within a very short time. It felt a bit overwhelming at first, but I also ran into 404 errors when deploying on GitHub Pages, and I learned that relative paths are very important for linking files correclty. ./ instead of /

What am I most proud of in my site?

I’m proud that I was able to troubleshoot deployment issues on my own and successfully host my portfolio online for others to see. I’m most proud of being able to turn my design into a real website. It was really satisfying to see my ideas come to life on the screen and actually work the way I imagined.
